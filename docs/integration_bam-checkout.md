# BAM Checkout SDK for iOS
BAM Checkout is a powerful, cutting-edge solution to extract data from your customer´s credit card and / or ID in your mobile application within seconds, including home address. It fits perfectly, and fully automates, every checkout flow to avoid manual input at all which leads to an increased conversion rate.

## Release notes
For changes in the technical area, please read our [transition guide](transition-guide_bam-checkout.md).

#### Fixes
* Miscellaneous bugfixes

## Setup
The [basic setup](../README.md#basic-setup) is required before continuing with the following setup for BAM Checkout.

## Initialization
Log into your Jumio merchant backend, and you can find your merchant API token and API secret on the "Settings" page under "API credentials". We strongly recommend to store credentials outside your app. In case the token and secret are not set in the `BAMCheckoutConfiguration` object, an exception will be thrown. Whenever a exception is thrown, the `BAMCheckoutViewController` instance will be nil and the SDK is not usable. Make sure that all necessary configuration is set before the `BAMCheckoutConfiguration` instance is passed to the initializer.

```
BAMCheckoutConfiguration *config = [BAMCheckoutConfiguration new];
config.merchantApiToken = @"YOURAPITOKEN";
config.merchantApiSecret = @"YOURAPISECRET";
config.dataCenter = JumioDataCenterEU; // Change this parameter if your merchant account is in the EU data center. Default is US.
config.delegate = self;

BAMCheckoutViewController *bamCheckoutViewController;
@try {
	bamCheckoutViewController = [[BAMCheckoutViewController alloc] initWithConfiguration:config];
} @catch (NSException *exception) {
	// HANDLE EXCEPTION
}
```

It is possible to update parameters of the configuration in case a scan was finished with error and the user is required to perform another scan. This can only be used if the SDK is currently not presented.
```
[bamCheckoutViewController updateConfiguration:config];
```

Make sure initialization and presentation are timely within one minute. On iPads, the presentation style `UIModalPresentationFormSheet` is default and mandatory.
```
[self presentViewController: bamCheckoutViewController animated: YES completion: nil];
```

## Configuration

### Card details

BAM Checkout supports Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay, Discover, Diners and Starbucks. To restrict supported card types, set a bitmask of `BAMCheckoutCreditCardTypes` to the property `supportedCreditCardTypes`.
```
BAMCheckoutCreditCardTypes cardTypes = BAMCheckoutCreditCardTypeAmericanExpress |
BAMCheckoutCreditCardTypeMasterCard | BAMCheckoutCreditCardTypeVisa;
config.supportedCreditCardTypes = cardTypes;
```

The recognition of card holder name, expiry recognition and CVV entry is enabled by default and can be disabled. You can also enable recognition of sort code and account number for credit cards of the UK. In case the user is supposed to edit expiry date or card holder name in a step after the scan, set the appropriate properties for editing.
```
config.cardHolderNameRequired = NO;
config.sortCodeAndAccountNumberRequired = YES;
config.expiryRequired = NO;
config.cvvRequired = NO;
config.expiryEditable = YES;
config.cardHolderNameEditable = YES;
```

### Transaction identifiers
Specify your reporting criteria to identify each scan attempt in your reports (max. 100 characters).
Note: This is not used for offline scanning.
```
config.merchantReportingCriteria = @"YOURREPORTINGCRITERIA";

```

### Offline scanning
In your Jumio merchant backend on the "Settings" page under "API credentials" you can find your Offline token.
```
config.offlineToken = @"YOUROFFLINETOKEN";
```

In case the bundle identifier of your app does not match with the token, the expiration date of the token is reached or if the token itself is invalid value an exception will be thrown at initialization time and `bamCheckoutViewController` will be nil.

### Miscellaneous
You can set a short vibration (only on iPhone) and sound effect to notify the user that the card has been detected.
```
config.vibrationEffectEnabled = YES;
config.soundEffect = @"YOURSOUNDFILE.aif";
```

Use cameraPosition to configure the default camera (front or back).
```
config.cameraPosition = JumioCameraPositionFront;
```

To enable flashlight after SDK is started, use the following method.
```
config.enableFlashOnScanStart = YES;
```

To show the unmasked card number during the user journey, disable the following setting.
```
config.cardNumberMaskingEnabled = NO;
```

You can add custom fields to "Additional info" view (text input field or selection list).
```
[config addCustomField: @"idZipCode" title: @"Zip code" keyboardType: UIKeyboardTypeNumberPad regularExpression: @"[0-9]{5}"];
[config addCustomField: @"idState" title: @"State" values: yourArray required: NO resetValueText: @"-- no value --"];
```

The style of the status bar can be specified.
```
config.statusBarStyle = UIStatusBarStyleLightContent;
```

### Custom scan view
The BAM Checkout SDK gives the opportunity to use a completely customized scan view, that is created by you and just uses a protocol to control the scanning process as well as get informed about certain events. The following actions and events are offered.
* Get location and dimension of card frame
* Check if front and back camera available
* Get camera position (front or back)
* Switch between front and back camera
* Check if flash available
* Check if flash enabled
* Switch flash mode (on or off)
* Restart card scanning if retry possible upon error
* Stop card scanning

To get started, subclass `BAMCheckoutCustomScanOverlayViewController` and see the protocol `BAMCheckoutCustomScanOverlayViewControllerDelegate`. Once the native method `viewDidAppear` is called in your subclass, the actions and events are available.

```
config.customOverlay = yourCustomScanOverlayViewController;
```

For more detailed information about how to use the custom scan view, please check out our sample project.

## Customization
The SDK can be customized to fit your application’s look and feel via the UIAppearance pattern. Check out our sample project on how to use it.
* General: disable blur, background color, foreground color, font
* Navigation bar: title image, title color, tint color and bar tint color
* Positive button (Submit): title color and background
* Negative button (Cancel): title color and background
* Scan overlay: border color, text color

## Delegation
Implement the delegate methods of the `BAMCheckoutViewControllerDelegate` protocol to be notified of scan attempts, successful scans and error situations. Dismiss the SDK view in your app in case or success or error.

#### Scan attempt
You receive a Jumio scan reference for each attempt, if the Internet connection is available. For offline scans the parameter scanReference will be nil.
```
- (void) bamCheckoutViewController: (BAMCheckoutViewController *) controller didStartScanAttemptWithScanReference: (NSString *) scanReference {
	// YOURCODE
}
```

#### Success
Upon success, the parameter `cardInformation` will be returned. Call clear after processing the card information to make sure no sensitive data remains in the device's memory.
```
- (void) bamCheckoutViewController: (BAMCheckoutViewController *) controller didFinishScanWithCardInformation: (BAMCheckoutCardInformation *) cardInformation scanReference: (NSString *) scanReference {
	// YOURCODE
	[cardInformation clear];
}
```

#### Error
This method is fired when the user presses the cancel button upon an error situation. The parameter _error_ contains an error code and a message, also the corresponding scan reference is available.
Note: The error codes 200, 210, 220, 240, 250, 260 and 310 will be returned. Using the custom scan view, the error codes 260 and 310 will be returned.
```
- (void) bamCheckoutViewController: (BAMCheckoutViewController *) controller didCancelWithError: (NSError*) error scanReference:(NSString *)scanReference {
	// YOURCODE
}
```
