# Document Verification SDK for iOS
Document Verification is a powerful solution to enable scanning various types (Utility Bill, Bank statement and many others) of your customer's documents in your mobile application within seconds, also supporting data extraction from Utility Bills and Bank Statements from US, UK, France and Canada, as well as US Social Security Cards.

## Release notes
For changes in the technical area, please read our [transition guide](transition-guide_document-verification.md).

#### Fixes
* Miscellaneous bugfixes

## Setup
The [basic setup](../README.md#basic-setup) is required before continuing with the following setup for DocumentVerification.

## Initialization
Log into your Jumio merchant backend, and you can find your merchant API token and API secret on the "Settings" page under "API credentials". We strongly recommend to store credentials outside your app. In case the token and secret are not set in the `DocumentVerificationConfiguration` object, an exception will be thrown. Whenever a exception is thrown, the `DocumentVerificationViewController` instance will be nil and the SDK is not usable. Make sure that all necessary configuration is set before the `DocumentVerificationConfiguration` instance is passed to the initializer.

```
DocumentVerificationViewController *config = [DocumentVerificationViewController new];
config.merchantApiToken = @"YOURAPITOKEN";
config.merchantApiSecret = @"YOURAPISECRET";
config.dataCenter = JumioDataCenterEU; // Change this parameter if your merchant account is in the EU data center. Default is US.
config.delegate = self;

DocumentVerificationViewController *documentVerificationViewController;
@try {
	documentVerificationViewController = [[DocumentVerificationViewController alloc] initWithConfiguration:config];
} @catch (NSException *exception) {
	// HANDLE EXCEPTION
}
```

It is possible to update parameters of the configuration in case a scan was finished with error and the user is required to perform another scan. This can only be used if the SDK is currently not presented.

```
[documentVerificationViewController updateConfiguration:config];
```

Make sure initialization and presentation are timely within one minute. On iPads, the presentation style _UIModalPresentationFormSheet_ is default and mandatory.

```
[self presentViewController: documentVerificationViewController animated: YES completion: nil];
```

## Configuration

### Document type
Set the parameter `type` in the DocumentVerificationConfiguration object to pass the document type.
```
config.type = @"BC";
```

Possible types:

*  BS (Bank statement)
*  IC (Insurance card)
*  UB (Utility bill, front side)
*  CAAP (Cash advance application)
*  CRC (Corporate resolution certificate)
*  CCS (Credit card statement)
*  LAG (Lease agreement)
*  LOAP (Loan application)
*  MOAP (Mortgage application)
*  TR (Tax return)
*  VT (Vehicle title)
*  VC (Voided check)
*  STUC (Student card)
*  HCC (Health care card)
*  CB (Council bill)
*  SENC (Seniors card)
*  MEDC (Medicare card)
*  BC (Birth certificate)
*  WWCC (Working with children check)
*  SS (Superannuation statement)
*  TAC (Trade association card)
*  SEL (School enrolment letter)
*  PB (Phone bill)
*  USSS (US social security card)
*  SSC (Social security card)
*  CUSTOM (Custom document type)

#### Custom Document Type
Use the following method to pass your custom document code. Maintain your custom document code within your Jumio merchant backend under "Settings" - "Document Verifications" -
"Custom".
```
config.customDocumentCode = @"YOURCUSTOMDOCUMENTCODE";
```

### Country

The country needs to be in format [ISO-3166-1 alpha 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) or XKX for Kosovo.
```
config.country= @"USA";
```

### Transaction identifiers
Specify your reporting criteria to identify each scan attempt in your reports (max. 100 characters).
```
config.merchantReportingCriteria = @"YOURREPORTINGCRITERIA";
```

To send some additional information use the property additionalInformation.
```
config.additionalInformation = @"ADDITONAL INFORMATION";
```
__Note:__ Additional information for this scan should not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login.

A callback URL can be specified for individual transactions, for constraints see chapter [Callback URL](https://github.com/Jumio/implementation-guides/blob/master/netverify/callback.md#callback-url). This setting overrides your Jumio merchant settings.
```
config.callbackUrl = @"YOURCALLBACKURL";
```

### Miscellaneous
Use the following property to identify the scan in your reports (max. 100 characters) and set a customer identifier (max. 100 characters).
```
config.merchantScanReference = @"YOURSCANREFERENCE";
config.customerId = @"CUSTOMERID";
```
__Note:__ The customer ID and merchant scan reference should not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login.

Use cameraPosition to configure the default camera (front or back).
```
config.cameraPosition = JumioCameraPositionFront;
```

The style of the status bar can be specified.
```
config.statusBarStyle = UIStatusBarStyleLightContent;
```

## Customization

The SDK can be customized to fit your applicationâ€™s look and feel via the UIAppearance pattern. Check out our sample project on how to use it.
* Navigation bar: title image, title color, tint color and bar tint color
* General: disable blur, background color, foreground color, font
* Positive button (Submit): title color and background
* Negative button (Cancel): title color and background
* Camera and flash toggle button: title color and background

## Delegation
Implement the delegate methods of the _DocumentVerificationViewControllerDelegate_ protocol to be notified of successful initialisation, successful scans and error situations. Dismiss the SDK view in your app in case or success or error.

### Success
Upon success, the scan reference is returned.
```
- (void) documentVerificationViewController:(DocumentVerificationViewController*) documentVerificationViewController didFinishWithScanReference:(NSString*)scanReference  {
	// YOURCODE
}
```

### Error
This method is fired when the user presses the cancel button upon an error situation. The parameter _error_ contains an error code and a message.
```
- (void) documentVerificationViewController:(DocumentVerificationViewController*) documentVerificationViewController didFinishWithError:(NSError*)error {
	// YOURCODE
}
```

**_Error codes_** that are available via the `code` property of the NSError object:

|Code | Message | Description |
| :-------------: |:----------|:-------------|
| 100<br/>110<br/>130<br/>140<br/>150<br/>160 | We have encountered a network communication problem | Retry possible, user decided to cancel |
| 210<br/>220 | Authentication failed | API credentials invalid, retry impossible |
| 230 | No Internet connection available | Retry possible, user decided to cancel |
| 250 | Cancelled by end-user | No error occurred |
| 260 | The camera is currently not available | Camera cannot be initialized, retry impossible |
| 280 | Certificate not valid anymore. Please update your application | End-to-end encryption key not valid anymore, retry impossible |
